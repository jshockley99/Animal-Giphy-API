# Animal GIPHY App

This app leverages the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. 

An initial selection of animals is displayed at the top of the page on the buttons.

Additional animals can be added to the selection by typing in the Search bar.

When clicking on a button, the page will display 10 related non-animated gif images.

When clicking on any of the still gif images, the gif will animate. Clicking the gif again will stop the animation.

Under every gif is the rating (PG, G, etc.).

Enjoy!
